Project: Application form to kindergarten

The main idea for this project was to create an application form to a website of a kindergarten where parents can apply a place in the kindergarten for their children. 

This information is stored to a MySql- database what you can easily manage from the admin page. For example, you can find all the allergies ect. in an easy way.

At the moment you can fill the contact form which sends all the info to a database. The admin- page is working and you can use a search function to find details from the database and also delete complete rows.
